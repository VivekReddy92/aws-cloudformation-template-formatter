## AWS Cloudformation Template Formatter

This repository contains `cfn-format`, a command line tool and Go library that reads in an existing AWS CloudFormation template and outputs a cleanly-formatted, easy-to-read copy of the same template adhering to standards as used in AWS documentation. `cfn-format` can output either YAML or JSON as desired.
